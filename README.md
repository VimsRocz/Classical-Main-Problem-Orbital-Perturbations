# Classical-Main-Problem-Orbital-Perturbations
This project investigates the secular and periodic perturbations of Keplerian orbital elements due to Earth's oblateness (dynamical flattening). The code will calculate and analyze perturbations for the CHAMP satellite, with visualizations to demonstrate their effects.
